-- v1.7 (Sep 13, 2008)
   - TGFX Support
   - Improved Genesis 6 Button auto-detection
   - Mode button now usable with Genesis 6 Button controllers
   - Sega style Multitap support (tested with MK-1654 only!)

--- v1.6 (Dec 12, 2007)
   - Changed the button IDs. Atari and SMS controllers were
     using button 2 and 3. Some emulators require button 1 so....
   - Added a way to force 6 Button mode for genesis controllers. Just
     in case your 6 button controller is not detected. Hold 'start' when connecting
	 the USB cable to use this feature.

--- v1.5 (Nov 10, 2007)
	- Added support for Genesis 3 and 6 button controllers.
	- All DB9 controllers (Genesis 3/6, SMS, Atari style 1 or 2 button and
	compatible) are auto-detected.
	- The wiring is now different for Atari style controllers. Easier to wire
	to the multiuse PCB.
	- NES controllers are now detected in SNES mode. This works great with
	original Nintendo controllers. If you have trouble with clones, use
	NES-only mode.
	- The project is now released under the GPL v2 license.

--- v1.4 (Dec 3, 2006)
	- Added support for Atari style joysticks. Two button
	  variations (SMS) are supported.
	- Added padding to nes report descriptor. This makes it
	  work correcly on windows. Linux sure is tolerant...

--- v1.3 (Oct 28, 2006)
	- Fixed a bug in nes.c, snes.c and snesmouse.c which prevented the pullup
		on the data pin (from device) from being enabled. This resulted in
		random button toggling when no controller was connected.
	- A separate USB PID is used when in NES mode.
	- PD1 is now left as input (no pullup) since it is shorted with PD0 on the
	  PCB rev.C. (And I didnt want to scrap a batch of 50 pcb nor cut a track
	  and solder a wire 50 times...)

--- v1.2 (Oct 6, 2006)
Added serial number
Added support for Snes mouse (auto detected in snes mode)
	- Default speed: Low
	- 3 Speeds selectable by holding some buttons at
	  startup (USB connect or mouse connect)
	  Left+right buttons: Low speed
	  Left buton: Medium speed
	  Right button: High speed
	  No button: Default speed when USB connect,
	  			continue using same speed for mouse (re)-connect

--- v1.1
Reworked report descriptor for better behaviour 
in Windows and Mac OS X

--- v1.0 (Jul 5, 2006)
Initial release:
Snes gamepad support
Nes gamepad support
